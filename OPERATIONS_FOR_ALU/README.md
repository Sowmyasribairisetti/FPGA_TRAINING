# ALU Design using IP Integrator (Work in Progress)

This project demonstrates the design of an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Xilinx Vivado's IP Integrator** and tested on the **Basys 3 FPGA**.

Today, a few basic operations were implemented. The complete ALU design including all operations will be finalized soon.
