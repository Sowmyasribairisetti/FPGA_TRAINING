# Full Adder & Subtractor Implementations on Basys 3 FPGA

This repository showcases Verilog implementations of:
- âœ… Full Adder  
- âœ… Full Subtractor  
- âœ… Full Adder using Two Half Adders  
- âœ… Full Subtractor using Two Half Subtractors  

All designs are developed using **Xilinx Vivado** and tested on the **Basys 3 FPGA** board. This is part of practical learning in **VLSI Design Training Sessions**.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Hardware

- **FPGA Board**: Basys 3 (Artix-7 XC7A35T)
- **Software**: Xilinx Vivado (2020.2 or later)
- **HDL**: Verilog
- **Modeling Styles**: Behavioral, Structural (for hierarchical designs)
