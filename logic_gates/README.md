# Logic Gates Implementation on Basys 3 FPGA

This repository contains Verilog implementations of basic logic gates using three different modeling styles: **Behavioral**, **Structural**, and **Dataflow**. The projects are developed as part of **VLSI training sessions** using **Xilinx Vivado Design Suite** and targeted for the **Basys 3 FPGA development board**.

## üìò Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand and demonstrate the three major modeling styles in Verilog HDL:

1. **Behavioral Modeling** ‚Äì Describes the logic using high-level behavioral constructs.
2. **Dataflow Modeling** ‚Äì Describes the flow of data using continuous assignment.
3. **Structural Modeling** ‚Äì Describes the design as a hierarchy of interconnected components, like a schematic.

Each gate (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) has been implemented using all three modeling styles and tested on the Basys 3 board.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Hardware

- **Hardware**: Basys 3 FPGA (Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A35T)
- **Software**: Xilinx Vivado (Version 2019)
- **HDL**: Verilog
